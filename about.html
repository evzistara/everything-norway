    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>
      My name is Evzi and I moved to Norway in 2020. I thought the process was
      kinda draining with trying to figure out what permit do I need, how do I
      open a bank account, what the hell is BankID and why is it utmost
      difficult to get a norwegian sim card.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I really love to research stuff and I also like to share knowledge and
      help out other people. There is absolutely no reason the process of moving
      being so difficult. We have to worry about leaving our old life behind and
      starting the new one and stressing about what kind of papers to fill out
      shouldn’t be the main focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why I decided to create this webpage together with a Tik Tok
      account, where I try to explain everything you need when you move to
      Norway in a simple and understandable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is obviously a lot of info for different situations and I will try
      to gather everything possible so this website is a living and growing
      thing. Please bear with me while I am gathering all the info.
    </p>
    <p>If you are missing anything specific, let me know on the email below!</p>
    <p>With love,</p>
    <p>Evzi</p>
